# Salmon Cookie Calculator
the following html, css and JavaScript make up a website for Pat's Salmon Cookies, including some background on the store and a set of calculators. The calculators generate a random number in the range of customers per hour in the store, multiply that by the average cookies bought per customer, and form a list of how many cookies a location can expect to sell per hour, followed by a total.

### Instructions:
open the index.html file in the web browser of your choice and enjoy the site. Refreshing the page will update the salmon cookie calculators automatically.
